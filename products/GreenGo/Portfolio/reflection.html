        <section id="reflection-part-A">
            <h2>Part A</h2>
            <section> 
                <h3>Insights</h3>  
                     
                <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong>My initial research into historical datasets revealed their potential for the project. The Bikeway Sections and Drinking Fountain datasets provided key information, inspiring the development of the bike lane explorer, search filter, and review system.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Collaboration and Communication:</strong> Structured communication became essential for aligning the team’s ideas. Regular peer reviews and academic insights on design helped streamline our process, making future tasks more efficient.</li>
            </section>
           

            <section>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <li><strong>Team Alignment:</strong>Intially, the team struggled to unify around a single direction due to varying ideas. This led to lengthy discussions, but eventually, a clear focus was established.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Management:</strong>Managing deadlines while iterating on feedback proved difficult, as revisions added more work. Moreover, finding the best time for weely meetings is also a challenge.</li>
            </section>

            <section> 
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>       
                <li>Overall, this part was a great exploration of the datasets. Me and my group had formed a good understanding of the data and the questions we were trying to answer. We had a clear plan on how to approach the problem and we were able to successfully implement the necessary code to wrangle the data.</li>

        <section id="reflection-part-B">
            <h2>Part B</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <li><strong>Prototype Testing:</strong>Early testing identified usability issues, helping us refine the design and improve user interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Close collaboration with the prototype developer ensured key interactions were tested and feedback was quickly integrated.</li>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <li><strong>Iteration Cycles:</strong>Addressing usability feedback required multiple iterations, making the process time-consuming.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Feedback:</strong> Incorporating user feedback while maintaining the project’s original vision was challenging but necessary.</li>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <li>This part was a great learning experience. I got to see how a user-centered design process works and how important it is to involve the users in the development process. I also got to see how important collaboration is in the development process and how it can help to overcome challenges.</li>

        <section id="reflection-part-C">
            <h2>Part C</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <li><strong>Starting the Codebase:</strong> I began by setting up the basic structure of the website, including organizing files and creating consistent styles for the dynamic navigation bar. This process also gave me the chance to explore and implement CSS animations.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration and Feedback:</strong> Regular team discussions played a crucial role in balancing functionality with aesthetics, particularly for complex features like the bike lane explorer.</li>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <li><strong>Balancing Functionality and Aesthetics:</strong> Maintaining the balance between visual appeal and functionality was a key challenge, especially for the interactive map. Despite trials with the scaling animation and API integration, the map remained somewhat messy.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Due to limited time, I couldn’t fully resolve the visual issues with the map. This remains an area for further refinement as we approach the final stages of the project.</li>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <li>This part was a major step in terms of technical implementation. While I faced challenges, especially with the map’s functionality, it deepened my understanding of balancing aesthetics and usability. I look forward to refining the design further, implementing advanced search filters, and adding more features in the final version.</li>
