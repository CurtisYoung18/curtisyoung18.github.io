# Portfolio Project

> Student Name: Zhiyang Mei

## Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website created as part of the DECO7180 course. The portfolio showcases my work across various design projects and reflects on my learning process throughout the semester. This website is entirely custom-built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks like Bootstrap or React, in line with course requirements.

## Structure
The portfolio contains the following sections:
- **Home**: A welcoming landing page with an overview of the project.
- **About Me**: An introduction to my background and interests.
- **Portfolio**: A display of selected projects with case studies, visuals, and descriptions.
- **Reflection**: My critical reflection on learning outcomes and process for each project part.
- **Contact**: A simple form for visitors to reach out to me and a message board.

## User Experience Considerations
Key UX elements have been incorporated to ensure an intuitive and smooth browsing experience:
- **Structure**: The portfolio is organized into clear sections with a consistent navigation bar.
- **Visibility**: All content is accessible and readable, with appropriate text size and contrast.
- **Feedback**: Interactive elements, such as buttons, provide visual feedback to guide users.
- **Error Prevention**: The contact form includes basic validation to prevent incorrect submissions.
- **Transparency**: Card elements have a transparency of 0.4 to create a unique visual effect.

## Technical Proficiency
This website demonstrates proficiency in:
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5 elements are used for accessibility and structure.
- **CSS**: Custom styling with modern layout techniques like Flexbox are used to ensure responsive design. Transparency effects are applied to card elements.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features such as the navigation bar, form validation, and message board functionality are implemented using vanilla JavaScript.
- **EmailJS Integration**: The contact form uses EmailJS to send messages directly from the client-side, enhancing user experience.

## Featured Functionality
- **Interactive Portfolio**: The portfolio page features a dynamic "Next Part" button that allows users to navigate through different project parts.
- **Email Integration**: The contact form is integrated with EmailJS, allowing visitors to send messages directly from the website without server-side code.
- **Message Board**: A simple message board displays submitted messages, enhancing interactivity.

## Code Structure and Documentation
All code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability:
- **HTML/CSS**: Tabbing, spacing, and meaningful naming conventions are used.
- **JavaScript**: Variables and functions are appropriately named, and comments explain functionality where necessary.
